    "# Presentation\n",
    "This repository contains a fully automated Python pipeline that scrapes league tables, recent results, and upcoming fixtures from **SoccerStats.com** for 60+ leagues from different continents and divisions (e.g., D1, D2, and D3 where applicable). The script also processes the data, and computes a set of probability indicators for matches finishing with **over 2.5 goals**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script extracts historical results, upcoming fixtures, team scoring profiles, and builds combined probability estimates based on home/away tendencies and statistical variance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The output is delivered as Excel workbooks (full data and treated data) designed for quick filtering, ranking, and decision support.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What this project does\n",
    "- Scrapes performance tables (total number of games, last 8, home, away) and parses results/fixtures per league.  \n",
    "- Builds team-level profiles of goals scored and conceded based on:\n",
    "  - all fixtures played so far, last 8 matches, home games, and away games.  \n",
    "  - mean and standard deviation (goals scored (GS)/goals conceded (GC)).\n",
    "- Derives match probabilities for games finishing with over 2.5 goals using:\n",
    "  - low and average bounds based on the previous number of games that finished over 2.5 goals.  \n",
    "  - home/away over 2.5 goals tendencies.  \n",
    "  - GS/GC means and SDs combined (worst- and best-case expectations).  \n",
    "- Ranks upcoming matches using a multi-criteria sort (low-bound prob, average home/away prob, sums of GS/GC means & SDs, games played).  \n",
    "- Exports tidy, analysis-ready Excel files (full + treated).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is produced\n",
    "The pipeline creates two Excel workbooks:\n",

    "### 1️⃣ Full Data\n",
    "**Filename:** `FullDatabase+2.5Goals_<DD-MM-YYYY>.xlsx`  \n",
    "**Sheets:**\n",
    "- `OverUnderGoalsTotalFullTime`:\n",
    "  - league information\n",
    "  - games played (GP)\n",
    "  - information about next match\n",
    "  - low and high bound probability of the games finishing with +2.5 goals (based on the proportion of previous home and away matches that each team’s games ended with over 2.5 goals)\n",
    "  - probability (home and away) based on the proportion of previous matches in which the home team’s home games and the away team’s away games ended with over 2.5 goals\n",
    "  - goals scored and conceded by the home team at home games (means and SDs)\n",
    "  - goals scored and conceded by the away team at away games (means and SDs)  \n",
    "- `Results` – parsed historical results (date, teams, score)  \n",
    "- `Fixtures` – upcoming fixtures (date, time, teams)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ Treated Data\n",
    "**Filename:** `Treated_+2.5Goals_<DD-MM-YYYY>.xlsx`  \n",
    "**Sheet:**\n",
    "- `TreatedData` – filtered view with:\n",
    "  - GP ≥ 12  \n",
    "  - low-bound home/away O2.5 ≥ 50.    \n",
    "  - Defines the best and worst case scenarios for a match finishing with over 2.5 goals:\n",
    "    - *Worst-case scenario*:\n",
    "      - Home team’s expected goals = the lower value between their average goals scored at home and the average goals conceded by the away team.\n",
    "      - Away team’s expected goals = the lower value between their average goals scored away and the average goals conceded by the home team.\n",
    "    - *Best-case scenario*:\n",
    "      - Home team’s expected goals = the higher value between their average goals scored at home and the average goals conceded by the away team.\n",
    "      - Away team’s expected goals = the higher value between their average goals scored away and the average goals conceded by the home team.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How the script works\n",
    "### 🔹 Scraping & parsing\n",
    "- Fetches league pages from **SoccerStats.com**, parses the main table (`id=\"btable\"`), and keeps O/U rows.  \n",
    "- From the results/fixtures pages, identifies rows by a date pattern (e.g., `Mon 4 Nov`), and splits results vs fixtures.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Team metrics\n",
    "- For each team, the script collects GS/GC series for all fixtures played so far, last 8 matches, home games, and away games.  \n",
    "- Compute mean and SD per series.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Match enrichment\n",
    "- Create “Next match” strings and propagate per-team metrics.  \n",
    "- Compute low and high bound probabilities of games finishing over 2.5 goals.  \n",
    "- Combine GS and GC means & SDs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Ranking & export\n",
    "- Estimates the best and worst case scenarios and ranks teams according to the highest probability of their matches finishing with over 2.5 goals.    \n",
    "- Write Full Data and Treated Data workbooks."
